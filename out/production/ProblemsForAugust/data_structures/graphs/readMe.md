## Graphs

Finite set of Vertices (nodes) and a set of Edges that
connect a pair of nodes.
G = (V, E)

In memory of,
1. Vertices
2. Edge
3. Unweighted Graph
4. Weighted Graph
5. Undirected Graph
6. Directed Graph
7. Cyclic graph (at least one loop)
8. Acyclic graph (no loop)
9. Positive weighted graph (directed/undirected)
10. Negative weighted graphs (directed/undirected)

### Tree: A special case of directed acyclic graphs


## Representation

1. Adjacency Matrix: 2D Array / Tabular form
2. Adjacency List: LinkedList with each node

* If graph is complete or almost complete -> use Adj Matrix 
* If number of edges are few then -> use Adj List
