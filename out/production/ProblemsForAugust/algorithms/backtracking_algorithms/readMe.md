* A form of recursion
* general algorithm for finding all solutions to some 
    computational problems
* these are called constraint satisfaction problems
* Used in solving combinatorial optimization problems (like TSP)
* faster than brute force enumeration of all complete candidates
* N queens or Sudoku
* Also called depth first search for trees
* Skips multiple bad states in a single step
